> More and more people buy and use their own cars. Do you think the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages for the environment? 


The last two decades have witnessed a significant increase in the number of private cars, which raises a debate on whether this trend brings more benefits for individuals than the damages to the environment. From my perspective, despite the convenience private cars may bring to us, we can never overlook potential environmental perturbations stemming from increased rolling cars.
 
Possessing a car is no doubt advantageous to individuals, and it particularly applies to those who reside in the countryside.

I believe we are all aware of several dire repercussions it might cause. For example, incessantly raising sea level is imposing a threat to the habitat of polar bears and therefore a latent risk of large-scale elimination of local species. Moreover, it is evident that deteriorating air quality is one of the major reasons for the rising rate of respiratory system diseases. Last but not least, cars are insatiable for physical space.

In conclusion, the advantages for individuals of increasing numbers of cars can not compensate for the disadvantages for the envi
